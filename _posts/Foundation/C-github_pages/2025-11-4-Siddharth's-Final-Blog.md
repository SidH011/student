# Compare yourself to the beginning of the year

### Compare yourself to the beginning of the year

## Before
In the beginning of the year, I came in eager to learn about the ventures of computer science, and this introductory course has done exactly that! At the start, I knew little about javascript and python. Additionally, from a softskills perspective, I didn't think much of hard deadlines and had no idea about the ideation process and how to properly plan and work.

## After
However, as the year progressed, through the help of the fabulous lessons, course work, and of course teacher, I was able to fully understand and begin implementing the fundamentals of these two concrete languages. Additionally, I had not a clue in the world about the realms of markdown, yet through the hands-on blog coding (like I’m doing now!) we had to do it, I was able to slowly but surely grasp the domains of the .md! Overall, I have come out of computer science 1 with knowledge I would have never imagined myself learning at the beginning of the year, and am beyond excited for what computer science 2 will behold!

## Remember key things from 3 sprints (Tools, Fundamentals of JavaScript,  Quest of Spook gamify.

### Sprint 1 - Tools

In the first sprint, we started off by setting up WSL, which stands for windows subsystem for linux. Upon setting this up, we deep dived into the worlds of github repositories, where we forked, cloned and set up our student repository and pages. From here, we learned about jekyll, committing, pulling requests, and finally ended with jupyter notebooks alongside a troubleshooting blog. Finally, we concluded the sprint by creating small games under and LxD mainpage, which brought together all of our learnings. In this, I created a snake game in which I added multiple tones of extra functionalities to the game, such as increased speed, difficulties, barriers, etc. 

Additionally, to showcase my learnings, I have created a troubleshooting blog about all of the utitilities we used

Overall, sprint 1 was the perfect introduction to the course, where we learned about the majority of the tools which we would be utilizing and understood the key fundamentals. 

### Sprint 2 - Fundamentals of JavaScript

During this sprint, we began analyzing and teaching lessons about the fundamentals of JavaScript, and showcasing these foundational skills through the “hacks” we had made in the previous sprint. During this time frame, we had to learn about the essential javascript topics of Variables, Booleans, Classes and Variables, Functions, Conditionals, Classes and Methods, Arrays, Strings, Data Abstraction, Classes and Constructors, Iteration, and Math Expressions. The lessons presented by my peers were amazing, and the hands-on homeworks and popcorn hacks made it so the learnings would stick. My group was in charge of creating the lessons/homeworks for Strings, alongside Classes/Constructors. During this timeframe, I was able to really enhance my learning of javascript, and the sprint was the perfect way of starting the learning process for the fundamentals of Javascript.

### Sprint 3 - Quest of Spook gamify

In Sprint 3, we brought all of our learnings together as a class to create one final, memorable, and superb project, the Quest of Spook. In this project, we were assigned to make a game prototype together as a whole and eventually present the N@tM. We together as class agreed on the base idea of the character being stuck in a mansion, with each table group making a level for the character to collect a key from, and ultimately escape with the use of these keys. Our group thought of the idea of creating a haunted casino, where the character had to play rounds of blackjack until winning the sum of $10,000 and unlocking the key. We work hard and tirelessly for days on end, ideating, planning, animating, and eventually coding. We started with creating our initial idea for how the map would be planned out, and soon were in the artworks stage. After finalizing our sprites, we began setting up our files and getting to work. After every commit, we would test, debug, and eventually pull requests to Mr.Mortensens github. After countless hours, we finally created a final product which we were happy with! It was awesome working as a whole class to create this fabulous experience to share at the N@tM, which I will cover next. 

## How N@tM went?  Did you get a comment or two you liked?

After observing for the first half hour or so at N@tM, we knew what our ask was. We quickly set up our booth, and got to speaking about our level. We had over 20 people come to our table and test our game, and all 20 gave it a positive review! Two comments which stuck out to me were one by Aadit Mathur which highlighted the transitions, user interface, and overall smoothness in which the game ran, and another review by a guest who very wisely suggested that we implement a quick menu which went over the full functionality of the game and how every aspect worked in unison. Overall, N@tM was a fabulous experience, where I not only got the opportunity to present our final project, but was additionally able to grasp great learnings from my peers/upperclassman alike.

## What do you want to do next on project, given time?

If given more time to work on this specific project, I would work on implementing the menu button as highlighted by a peer review during N@tM earlier, alongside adding more games to the casino to give the user options on how to escape. I really enjoyed working on this project, and given more time I would definitely do everything in my power to try and make the game the best possible experience for myself and others.

## What do you want to learn next in CompSci?

In the next CompSci, I want to learn more about the deeper concepts of JavaScript, and how these learnings can be applied. I would also like to start venturing into other, different languages, like python amongst others, which would further strengthen my learnings. Finally, I would like to learn about what an API is and its use, as I have seen this word plastered around the room numerous times and on open coding society platforms.

## Analytics review.

In total, on my personal student repository, I had over 70 commits, spanning to over 10,000 lines of code edited or added. I prided myself in documenting my learning journey on my student repository, and regularly updating it to include all learnings/lessons. Each sprint presented countless issues being posted, commits being saved, and lines being changed, which all added to my analytics score. Additionally, I have made over 50 commits on the jupiterian team repository, where I spent a majority of my time either working on the sprint 2 lessons, creating my snake game for sprint 1/hack 1, and finally creating the casino level for the sprint 3 mansion game. Each of these brought further issues being made, this time with the whole team collectively working to bring down the monstrous tasks at hand. Overall, week in and week out I put my all into working to do what is best for me, my team, and what the class curriculum asked for, and my analytics score is a proud representation I have of this.

## Something cool, you want to tell.

Something cool I wanted to tell you, is how we came across the idea of creating our background with each individual sprite, which I recall Mr.Mortenson quite enjoyed. As he talked about the game engine and its functionality, my mind sprung to how the collision systems and interactions would work. I realized the best method of achieving a clean, professional game would be to have each game object be its own entity, and upon sharing this idea with my team we sprang to work. After hours of searching, we finally came up with a final sprite sheet which we were happy with, and once getting the approval began implementing. This outside the box thinking which no other group during the project did is something which I found very cool, and also one that my team executed expertly! With each game object being its own entity, it made hit boxes and barrier collisions much more accurate then what would’ve been, and allowed for us to focus in on creating an as smooth as possible final product to behold. Additionally, the fading in details on our level and vibrant colors/user interface was something which I thought was cool, too!


## Final remarks
With this, I conclude my Computer Science 1 final blog. This course was everything I could’ve wished for as my introduction to computer science, and with the help of my excellent teacher and peers, I am now beyond excited for what the next computer science will hold!
