# Setting Up Your Python Environment by Using `venv` and `make`

## 1. Creating a Python Virtual Environment (`venv`)

A virtual environment helps isolate your Python dependencies for a project. To create one:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /home/sidh001/student
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment named `venv`:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
   This will create a folder called `venv` in your project directory.

## 2. Activating the Virtual Environment

To activate the virtual environment, run:
```bash
source /home/sidh001/student/venv/bin/activate
```
After activation, your terminal prompt will change, indicating that you are now using the virtual environment.

## 3. Using the `make` Command

The `make` command automates tasks defined in a file called `Makefile` (usually in your project root). Common tasks include installing dependencies, running tests, or building your project.

**Example usage:**
```bash
make install
```
This will run the `install` task defined in your `Makefile`.

**Note:** Always activate your virtual environment before running `make` if your tasks depend on Python packages.

## 4. Troubleshooting

### If `make` is not found:
- Install it using:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install make
  ```

### If `venv` is not found or fails to activate:
- Ensure you have Python 3 installed:
  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```
- If `venv` is missing, install it:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3-venv
  ```
- If activation fails, check the path and permissions.

### If Python packages are missing after activating `venv`:
- Install them using `pip`:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### If `make` tasks fail:
- Check your `Makefile` for typos or missing dependencies.
- Run the command manually to see detailed errors.

**Summary:**  
1. Create your virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv`.
2. Activate it using `source /home/sidh001/student/venv/bin/activate`.
3. Use `make` to automate tasks.
